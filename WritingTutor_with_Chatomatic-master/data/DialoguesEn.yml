          <p> Depending on the desired writing style, it is important to keep the overall mood of your essay in mind. You can learn more about this in the theory.
          <p> Often students simply forget to consciously use positive/negative or subjective elements in their essays. Your essay can become too one-sided by being too positive or negative, or it can become too subjective or objective.
                            I help you to keep track of both areas and thus build a good and balanced argument structure so that you can achieve your desired goal! &#128521; </p>

    - How is the sentiment measured?
    - "<p>There are a variety of methods used to measure sentiment by different researchers in the field.</p>
           <p>Sentiment analysis (also called opinion mining) uses natural language processing, text analysis and other linguistic tools to identify, analyse, structure and categorise a given text. This includes categorising the strength of opinion and objectivity, both of which form the overall mood of the text. &#128209;</p>

    - What is subjectivity/objectivity and how can I improve it?
    - "<p>Objectivity depends on the writing style you choose. It is very difficult to remain 100% objective when writing an argument. But depending on the audience you want to address, you should keep your subjectivity value in mind. When writing arguments, it is more beneficial to write an objective and fact-based text than to be subjective. The subjectivity of your text also reflects your emotional stance to some extent.
           The overall goal is to remain objective when writing argumentation.</p>

    - "<p>I would like to briefly explain how WritingTutor analyses your essay and argumentation skills. </p>
              <p>To analyse and score your essay, you need to type the whole essay into the text box that appears when you click on ''Open text box''.
   <p>Your task: <i> Your friend wants to go to the USA for a year. However, he has some concerns about this. </i> </p>
   <p><b>Please write a text of 250 to 300 words about the advantages and disadvantages of a year abroad. </b></p>

     <p>  Please ensure that your final essay is entered in full in the text box. This is important so that you get a complete analysis of the whole essay. If you only analyse a few paragraphs, you will get an incomplete overview of your essay.
              After you have received the results, you can improve your essay according to the results. If you need help in certain areas, I am happy to help you. &#128522; </p>

    - What is an argumentation?
    - "<p>The argumentation consists of a sequence of statements in which you support your thesis (assertion) with arguments (reasons) and evidence (e.g. provable facts).  &#128107;</p>

    - Could you elaborate more on the structure of arguments?
    - "<p>Yes, of course! I can go into further detail by explaining to you the structure of an argument.</p>
           <p>An argument consists of the following basic elements: Assertion, Reason and Proof/Example. Your claims should always be supported with the appropriate reasoning and, at best, evidence/examples.
           For example, consider the following argument: ''Because there are more hours of sunshine in summer (reason 1) and people are outside more (reason 2), their mental health is better. (assertion). This can be seen, for example, in the lower suicide rates in the summer months (proof/example)''.
           This example illustrates how a basic argument is formed</p>.
           <p>There are several ways to structure an argument. The basic argument is the simplest structure to create a complete argument. </p>
           <h4>Learning material</h4>
           <p>Here is a great video that goes into more detail. </p>

    - Can you tell me about the different parts of argumentative essays?
    - "<p>Yes, of course! Let me show you the outline in three different parts.</p>
           <p>An argument is divided into three parts: Introduction, Body and Conclusion.</p>
           <p>The introduction section of an argumentation should, on the one hand, arouse the reader's interest and, on the other hand, lead to the topic without already anticipating the first arguments or basic thoughts. At the end of the introduction follows your thesis (assertion), so it is the last sentence of the introduction.</p> <p>The main body is where you make at least your thesis.
           <p>In the main part, at least three arguments are developed that support the thesis. Each argument justifies the thesis and forms its own section. Each argument is illustrated with an example or evidence.
           <p>The concluding section of an argument once again summarises in short words your now consolidated conviction (thesis) and makes it clear that there is only this one logical conclusion for you.</p>
           <h4>Introduction, main body, conclusion</h4>.
           <p>Arguments - especially the arguments of the main body - should be presented objectively and factually to achieve the desired goal: to convince the reader.</p>
           <p>You should pay special attention to your emotional attitude when writing argumentation. In principle, it can be said that arguments should be kept neutral. However, this also depends on the context and the target group.
           With my help, you can always keep an eye on your emotional attitude!

    - What is strength of opinion and how can I improve it?
    - "<p>The strength of your text reflects your emotional preference. This can be positive or negative.
           A negative opinion strength value means that your essay is written negatively overall, while a positive value describes the exact opposite.
           The strength of opinion you aim for may depend on your writing style and your personal attitude towards the topic. You can intentionally adjust the strength of your essay by choosing appropriate adjectives.
           It makes a difference whether you say 'I like the film' or 'I love the film'. So if you adjust your wording, your text will take on a slightly different emotional tone. You can also formulate your arguments in a very neutral way.
           You can also formulate your arguments in a very neutral way, which will give your essay a more balanced and serious tone. As you can see, there is no right or wrong. You simply have to consciously choose a style. &#128515;</p>
           <p>Do you already know which writing style you want to choose? Below you will find a detailed explanation of the different writing styles and their applications.
