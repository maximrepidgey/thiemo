                     'reason': 'The text has a low readability score because of its language, style and tone. The author uses exaggeration to emphasize their point of view but the over-the-top language detracts from it. For example, in the introduction, the author claims that broccoli is the worst vegetable ever, which is an extreme assertion and not supported by facts. Moreover, the essay lacks coherence and logical flow. The main points outlined in each body paragraph are not well-connected, causing the argument to come across as disjointed. For instance, paragraph three abruptly switches topics from the resource drain on society to health concerns over consuming broccoli. In short, the essay would benefit from clearer argumentation and more persuasive language that presents harder evidence to support its claims.',
                     'improvement': "To improve the readability of this text, the following are three concrete examples:\n\n1. Change the tone: The author uses an aggressive and negative tone throughout the essay which can be off-putting to some readers. Instead, the author could adopt a more persuasive tone by presenting evidence that supports their claims in a more measured way. This will make the essay sound less like a rant and more like a well-reasoned argument.\n\n2. Use shorter paragraphs: The author's paragraphs are quite long and this can make it difficult for readers to follow their train of thought. Breaking up the text into smaller paragraphs would make it easier for readers to digest the information presented and help them stay engaged with the argument.\n\n3. Provide evidence: While the author makes many claims about broccoli, they don't provide any evidence to support these claims. Adding statistics or scientific studies that back up their arguments will make the essay more convincing and credible to readers. This would also strengthen their position as an authority on the topic."},
     'objectivity': {'info': 'objectivity', 'score': 1.25,
                     'reason': 'The text is extremely subjective and lacks objectivity. The writer starts with a statement that broccoli is the worst vegetable that exists, which suggests a preconceived bias. There is no evidence provided to present a more balanced perspective on the topic. Moreover, in each paragraph, the writer uses exaggeration and appeals to emotion to support their claim. For instance, describing the taste of broccoli as "terrible," and using phrases such as "no amount" and "never be consumed" present an extreme, biased view of the vegetable. The writer also fails to acknowledge any counterarguments or alternative perspectives, making the argument less persuasive.',
                     'improvement': 'To improve this text in terms of objectivity, here are three concrete examples:\n\n1. Replace subjective language with factual information: Instead of stating that broccoli has a terrible taste, provide objective evidence to support this claim such as data from taste tests or surveys. This will help to establish the argument without using exaggerated language.\n\n2. Provide counter-arguments and evidence: Objectivity requires acknowledging opposing arguments and providing evidence to refute them. In this case, the writer can acknowledge that some people enjoy eating broccoli and provide evidence for its health benefits.\n\n3. Avoid generalizations: The language used in the essay is sweeping and generalized. To be more objective, it is important to avoid making broad statements such as "no one wants to eat" broccoli and instead use more precise language like "some people find it difficult to enjoy."'},
     'conciseness': {'info': 'conciseness', 'score': 4.5,
                     'reason': "The text scores high in conciseness because it serves its purpose without wasting any words or beating around the bush. Each paragraph has a clear and definitive argument, adding value to the overall message and not repeating unnecessary information. For example, Body Paragraph 2 stresses that broccoli is a burden on the environment and offers evidence for why this is so. It mentions the resources that go into cultivating broccoli only to have most of it thrown away, further burdening the environment, making a strong counterpoint to those who might suggest that broccoli's health benefits outweigh any drawbacks. Overall, concise writing helps to get the point across more effectively and makes the text more convincing.",
                     'improvement': 'To improve the conciseness of this text, here are three examples:\n\n1. In the introduction, instead of saying "In this essay, I will argue that broccoli is overrated and should never be consumed," you can simply say "Broccoli is overrated and should never be consumed."\n\n2. In Body Paragraph 2, instead of saying "This makes it a burden on the environment and a waste of resources that could be used for more delicious and valuable crops," you can say "It\'s a burden on the environment and wasted resources."\n\n3. In the conclusion, instead of saying "It should be removed from our diets and replaced with better, more enjoyable vegetables," you can say "Replace it with other enjoyable vegetables."'},
     'structure': {'info': 'structure', 'score': 2.5,
                   'reason': 'The text has many flaws in its argumentative structure. Firstly, the author makes a sweeping statement in the introduction that broccoli is the worst vegetable without providing any rationale or evidence to support their claim. In addition, the author presents claims that are subjective and not universally proven. For instance, tastes differ from person to person, and it is not factual to state that "broccoli has a terrible taste." Another problem is that the author does not acknowledge any counter-arguments or provide evidence to refute opposing views. The entire essay relies heavily on personal opinions and lacks actual studies or data to support them. To make this essay more persuasive, the author must back up their arguments with verified data and avoid unsubstantiated generalizations.',
                   'improvement': '1. The introduction could be improved by providing more context on why broccoli is usually praised for its health benefits, and then introducing the contrasting argument that it is actually overrated. This would help set up the argument more effectively and engage the reader‚Äôs interest.\n\n2. Each body paragraph could be strengthened by including evidence to support the claims being made. For example, in paragraph 1, the author could include a survey or study showing that many people find broccoli unpalatable. In paragraph 2, the author could provide data on the environmental impact of growing and transporting broccoli compared to other crops. In paragraph 3, the author could cite research on the digestive effects of broccoli.\n\n3. The conclusion should summarize the main points of the essay and reiterate the argumentative stance taken by the author. However, it should also leave room for potential counterarguments or alternative perspectives. Instead of stating unequivocally that broccoli should be removed from our diets, the author could acknowledge that some people may still choose to eat it despite its drawbacks or argue that it could be consumed in moderation alongside other vegetables.'},
     'general': "The argumentative text makes a bold and controversial claim that broccoli is the worst vegetable ever. However, the author fails to provide any credible evidence to support this claim. The text is subjective and lacks objectivity, making it difficult to convince readers who may have a different perspective on broccoli. Furthermore, the author's tone is overly aggressive and dismissive towards those who enjoy eating broccoli, which may turn off some readers from engaging with the argument. Therefore, the author needs to include more concrete evidence and adopt a more persuasive tone if they want to convince readers of their claim."}
